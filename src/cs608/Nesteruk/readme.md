Overview: This is a repository of algorithm work completed while studying at Pace University.

Gcd.java: Implementation of Euclid's GCD algorithm.

BubbleSort.java: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. Stops the iteration when no swaps occur, and alternates the direction of each pass from low subscript to high, then from high to low, etc.

IterImprove.java: Implementation of the incremental improvement algorithm.

Partition.java & QuickSort.java: Implementation of a partition algorithm. The QuickSort algorithm is implemented using Partition.partition().

HuffmanWithHeap.java: Implementation of the Huffman minimum redundancy code algorithm.

FSM.java: A Finite State Machine executor. Algorithm is based on a class that accepts strings of the form zero or more "ab" or "aa" pairs followed by "aab" followed by zero or more "ba" pairs. Contains 20 test strings and three FSM builds.

CryptoTmpIt.java: implements modular exponentiation, primitive roots, and DHM key exchange protocol.
